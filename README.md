## M.S. Computer Science Student | LLM Systems, Full-Stack & Cloud-Native Apps

Passionate about building intelligent systems that are both technically sound and genuinely useful.

I’m a graduate student in Computer Science with a strong focus on **LLM-powered applications**,  
**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems, and **scalable backend architectures**.  
I enjoy working at the intersection of AI infrastructure, system design, and product engineering.

Currently pursuing my **M.S. in Computer Science**, I spend most of my time designing agentic workflows,  
optimizing inference pipelines, and deploying cloud-ready AI services.

I care deeply about the **entire product lifecycle** — from problem formulation and system design  
to deployment, evaluation, and iteration.
