## M.S. Computer Science Student | AI & LLM Systems | Full-Stack Development

Passionate about building intelligent systems that turn complex data into reliable, real-world products.

I’m an AI Engineer and Full-Stack Developer with a strong focus on **LLM-powered applications**, **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** systems, and **scalable backend architectures**. I enjoy working at the intersection of AI infrastructure, system design, and product engineering.

Currently pursuing my **M.S. in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Chicago**, I spend most of my time designing agentic workflows, optimizing inference pipelines, and deploying production-ready AI services to the cloud.

I have a deep interest in the **entire product lifecycle** — from idea and architecture to deployment and iteration. I value clean abstractions, pragmatic engineering, and building systems that are both technically sound and genuinely useful.
